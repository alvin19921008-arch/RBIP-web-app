# Playwright Smoke On-Demand

- Use smoke tests as step-wise refactor gates, not full regression suites.
- Prefer functional assertions over screenshot/snapshot diff.
- Keep runs fast: Chromium only, `@smoke` grep, trace only on failure.
- Do not load or apply this rule outside Playwright smoke test work.
